# 📊 Sales Dashboard Agent

> A LangGraph **sales analytics agent** that reads a CSV, computes product metrics,
> and generates interactive HTML dashboards for three audiences —
> all in one command, no server required.

## What this agent does

Reads any CSV with sales data → computes metrics for three audiences → writes HTML dashboards.

| Audience | Dashboard focus |
|---|---|
| **Executive** | Revenue, AOV, category mix, seasonality index |
| **Product Team** | Top products, SKU analysis, category × region heatmap |
| **Marketing / Growth** | Payment methods, regional trends, weekday patterns |

All three dashboards are combined into **one self-contained HTML file** with a tab switcher.
Open it in any browser — no server, no dependencies.

---

## Architecture

```
START → loader → metrics_computer → dashboard_builder → combiner → END
```

Each node is a pure function `AgentState → dict`. The graph uses a conditional edge
after `loader` to short-circuit on file errors without crashing.

## Expected CSV columns

The agent accepts the following column names. Alternative names are automatically
remapped by `loader.py` — no manual renaming needed.

| Canonical name | Accepted aliases | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Order ID` | `Transaction ID` | string | Unique transaction identifier |
| `Date` | — | date (ISO 8601) | Transaction date |
| `Category` | `Product Category` | string | Product category |
| `Product Name` | — | string | Specific product |
| `Quantity` | `Units Sold` | int | Units sold |
| `Unit Price` | — | float | Price per unit |
| `Total Price` | `Total Revenue` | float | `Quantity × Unit Price` |
| `Region` | — | string | Geographic region |
| `Payment Method` | — | string | e.g. Credit Card, PayPal |

## Quickstart

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/agent-sales-dashboard
cd agent-sales-dashboard

# With conda (recommended)
conda create -n agent-sales python=3.11 -y
conda activate agent-sales

pip install -e ".[anthropic]"
# or just: pip install langgraph langchain-core
```

### 2. Configure (optional)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set REPORTS_DIR if you want dashboards somewhere other than reports/
```

### 3. Run

```bash
# Basic run
python main.py --source datasets/sales.csv

# Open the combined dashboard in your browser immediately
python main.py --source datasets/sales.csv --open

# Verbose mode (shows LangGraph node execution)
python main.py --source datasets/sales.csv --verbose

# Save full agent state as JSON (useful for debugging)
python main.py --source datasets/sales.csv --output-json state.json
```

### 4. View the results

```
reports/
├── dashboard_exec_20240315_143201.html       <- Executive
├── dashboard_product_20240315_143201.html    <- Product Team
├── dashboard_marketing_20240315_143201.html  <- Marketing / Growth
└── dashboard_combined_20240315_143201.html   <- * All three with tab switcher
```

Open any file in a browser. `dashboard_combined_*.html` is the main deliverable —
it has three tabs with a colored tab switcher (purple / teal / coral).

## Running tests

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"

pytest                          # all tests
pytest tests/test_metrics.py   # metrics only
pytest tests/test_graph.py     # end-to-end (no LLM needed)
pytest -v --tb=short            # verbose
pytest --cov                    # with coverage
```

## Extending the agent

| Idea | Where |
|---|---|
| LLM-generated text summaries per dashboard | New node in `agents/graph.py` + `tools/summarizer.py` |
| Metric caching (skip recompute if file unchanged) | `memory/metric_cache.py` |
| PDF export of dashboards | New tool using `playwright` or `weasyprint` |
| Slack/email delivery of the combined HTML | New node `tools/notifier.py` |
| Filters by date range / region via CLI | `main.py` args + pass to `loader_node` |
| Multi-file comparison (month vs month) | New conditional branch in `graph.py` |
| Scheduled runs (cron / Airflow) | `main.py` returns exit code 0/1 for scripting |
